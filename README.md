# Divisbility.java
This class provides a method to check the divisibility of a number by 3 and/or 5.
Simply run the code and provide an input to see the response. 
If the number is divisible by 3 and 5, the program with print the statement "MustangBronco"
If the number is only divisible by 5, the program will print the statement "Bronco"
If the number is only divisible by 3, the program will print the statement "Mustang"
Otherwise, the number is divisible by neither and the program will print the number.
Finally, if the input is invalid, meaning it contains a non-integer, the program will ask the user to try again.
